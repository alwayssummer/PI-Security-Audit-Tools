SHORT DESCRIPTION
        The PI Security Audit Tools are a set of scripts that perform a set of security
	validations.

LONG DESCRIPTION
        This project is a framework to baseline the security configuration of your PI System. 
	This tool framework is built as a PowerShell module containing cmdlets to perform 
	different calls to collect the data from the security settings of different requested 
	PI System components.

	A series of PowerShell script files (*.psm1) form a single module named PI System Audit 
	Module (or PISysAudit Module) once loaded. You will find one core script containing the 
	collection logic and four library scripts containing the validation logic for different 
	topics such as best practices to harden the machine, PI Data Archive, etc. The module exposes 
	several cmdlets either used for the internal logic or the external interface with the 
	end-user.

	The PI System Audit Module (PISysAudit) requires PowerShell version 2 and later, it can 
	be executed locally or remotely and make use of existing command line utilities to 
	perform many tasks. This allows being compatible with many versions of the PI System.

	The current version of the PISysAudit module implements 16 validations covering: 
	machine (AU1XXXX), PI Data Archive (AU2XXXX), PI AF Server (AU3XXXX) and SQL Server (AU4XXXX) 
	best practices with the PI System.

VALIDATION CHECKS AND COMPLIANCE CONDITIONS
	
		//BEGINSECTION - VALIDATIONS// This section is automatically generated.

		AU10001 - Domain Membership Check
		VALIDATION: verifies that the machine is a member of an Active Directory Domain.  
		COMPLIANCE: join the machine to an Active Directory Domain.  Use of a domain is 
		encouraged as AD provides Kerberos authentication and is our best available technology 
		for securing a PI System.  Furthermore, the implementation of transport security in the 
		PI System relies on Windows Integrated Security and AD to automatically enable higher 
		strength ciphers.

		AU10002 - Operating System SKU
		VALIDATION: verifies that the OS Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is appropriate for 
		production use.
		COMPLIANCE: SKU should match one of the following: 12, 13, 14, 29, 39, 40, 41 or 42.  
		These SKUs were chosen to highlight the reduced attack surface area of a core 
		installation of Windows Server.  For more on the advantages of Windows Server Core, 
		please see:
		https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846314(v=vs.85).aspx

		AU10003 - Firewall Enabled
		VALIDATION: verifies that the Windows host based firewall is enabled. 
		COMPLIANCE: enable the Windows firewall.  A firewall's effectiveness is heavily
		dependent on the configuration.  For PI specific port requirements, see: 
		https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB01162.
		For more general information on the Windows firewall, see "Windows Firewall with 
		Advanced Security Overview" on TechNet:
		https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831365(v=ws.11).aspx.

		AU10004 - AppLocker Enabled
		VALIDATION: verifies that AppLocker is enabled.  
		COMPLIANCE: set AppLocker to Enforce mode after establishing a policy.  For a 
		primer on running AppLocker on a PI Data Archive, see:
		https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB00994

		AU10005 - UAC Enabled
		VALIDATION: verifies that UAC is enabled.  More precisely, it verifies the 
		following default features: EnableLUA, ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin, 
		EnableInstallerDetection, PromptOnSecureDesktop and EnableSecureUIAPaths.
		Additionally, a check is performed for the feature ValidateAdminCodeSignatures.  
		Lower severity is assigned if this is the only feature disabled.
		COMPLIANCE: enable the flagged UAC features.  For more information on specific
		UAC features, see:
		https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd835564(v=ws.10).aspx.

		AU20001 - PI Data Archive Table Security Check
		VALIDATION: examines the database security of the PI Data Archive and flags any 
		ACLs that contain access for PIWorld as weak. 
		COMPLIANCE: remove PIWorld access from all database security ACLs.  Note that prior
		removing PIWorld access, you need to evaluate which applications are relying on that 
		access so that you can grant those applications access explicitly.

		AU20002 - PI Admin Trusts Disabled Check
		VALIDATION: verifies that the piadmin PI User cannot be used in a PI Trust. 
		COMPLIANCE: disable Trusts with piadmin.  This can be done by checking "User 
		cannot be used in a Trust" in the Properties menu for the piadmin PI User.  To access
		this menu open use the Idenitities, Users, & Groups plugin in PI SMT, navigate to the 
		PI User tab, right click the piadmin entry and select Properties in the context menu.

		AU20003 - PI Data Archive SubSystem Version Check
		VALIDATION: verifies that the PI Data Archive is using the most recent release.   
		COMPLIANCE: upgrade the PI Data Archive to the latest version, PI Data Archive 
		2016 (3.4.400.1162).  For more information, see the "Upgrade a PI Data Archive Server" 
		section of the PI Data Archive Installation and Upgrade Guide, Live Library:

		AU20004 - Check Edit Days
		VALIDATION: verified that Edit Days is set. 
		COMPLIANCE: set to a value greater than zero.  EditDays defines the number of past 
		days where events can be modified in the Snapshot or Archive databases. A zero value means 
		no time check is done.  For instructions to set EditDays, see "Modify the EditDays tuning 
		parameter" section in the PI Data Archive System Management Guide:
		https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v7/GUID-0865CC31-BF8C-4347-B717-15071ED51399.

		AU20005 - Auto Trust Configuration
		VALIDATION: verifies that the autotrustconfig tuning parameter is set to create 
		either no trusts or a trust for the loopback automatically (127.0.0.1). 
		COMPLIANCE: set the autotrustconfig tuning parameter to a value of 0 (do not 
		automatically create any PI Trust entries) or 1 (create the trust entry for the loopback 
		IP address 127.0.0.1 only).

		AU20006 - Expensive Query Protection Check
		VALIDATION: verify that the PI Data Archive has protection against expensive queries. 
		COMPLIANCE: set the archive_maxqueryexecutionsec tuning parameter to a value between 60

		AU20007 - Check if the explicit login is disabled
		VALIDATION: verifies that explicit login is disabled as an authentication protocol.   
		COMPLIANCE: set the tuning parameter Server_AuthenticationPolicy to a value greater than 3.  
		This is equivalent to the third notch, "Disable explicit login", or higher on the Security 
		Settings plugin in PI SMT.  For more information, see "Security Best Practice #2" and "Security 
		Best Practice #3" in KB00833. 
		https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB00833

		AU20008 - Check if piadmin is not used
		VALIDATION: verifies that piadmin is not used in trusts or mappings. 
		COMPLIANCE: replace any trusts or mappings that use piadmin with a mapping or trust to a
		PI Identity with appropriate privilege for the applications that will use it.  For more

		order to change the user that the service is running as, open control panel, go to Programs, 
		Programs and Features, select the entry for the PI AF Server and click Change.  This will 
		launch the installer where you will be given the option to change configuration settings, 
		including the service account.

		AU30002 - Impersonation mode for AF Data Sets Check
		VALIDATION:  verifies the impersonation mode for external data tables. 
		COMPLIANCE: set the Configuration Setting ExternalDataTablesAllowNonImpersonatedUsers to 
		false, thereby requiring impersonation for access to external tables.  This setting can be 
		changed by running the AFDiag utility with the /ExternalDataTablesAllowNonImpersonatedUsers- 
		flag.  For more information, see "AFDiag utility parameters" in the PI Live Library.
